    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    When making an app with <a href="https://software.sil.org/scriptureappbuilder/download/">Scripture App Builder</a>, builders have the option of defining their own menu items, and SAB provides an easy way of accomplishing this. Some language groups have multiple scripts, and it can get tedious transliterating app menus into those different scripts. This utility helps app builders by providing a way to quickly use their existing <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?id=teckitintro&site_id=nrsi">TECkit map</a> or other transliteration process to quickly incorporate their automatically transliterated menus into SAB's menus. 
    <h2>Export your menu</h2>
    In SAB, go to Menus and export your current file. 
    <h2>Upload your menu</h2>
   Drag and drop to upload your exported menu file. 
    <h2>Choose your languages</h2>
    Menu Helper presents all the languages currently in your menu file and you can choose which is the source language and what language code you'd like to use to mark the transcriptions. For example if your language is Wolof (wol) and your transliterated script is Wolofal (wfl), your source is wol and your destination is wfl.
