    <h2>Download the file and import to SAB</h2>
    You should now have a good file you can import back into SAB in Appearance/Interface in the Translations tab. 
    If you have not yet added your transliteration into SAB, just be sure to add the language in Appearance/Interface in the Lanugages tab with the same language code. 
<br><br>
If you see problems with variables like <i>%s</i> or <i>%book</i>, you can deal with them in TECkit map by adding something like this after the SFM section:
<br><br>
<tt><pre>
----------------------------------------
; ----------<br>
; Scripture App Builder (SAB) related <br>
; ----------<br>
'%,d'                      >       '%,d'<br>
'%book '                   >       '%book '<br>
'%chapter '                >       '%chapter '<br>
'%s'                       >       '%s'<br>
----------------------------------------
</pre></tt>
<br><br>
    If something goes wrong or takes some time to figure out, you can go back to your earlier exported file.
